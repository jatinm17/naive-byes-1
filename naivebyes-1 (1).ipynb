    "Q1. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - P(A | B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.\n",
    "   - P(B | A) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred.\n",
    "   - P(A) is the prior probability of event A.\n",
    "   - P(B) is the prior probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Bayes' theorem is used in practice in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and data science, for tasks such as classification, spam filtering, medical diagnosis, and more. It allows you to update the probability of a hypothesis (A) based on new evidence (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Bayes' theorem and conditional probability are closely related. Bayes' theorem provides a framework for calculating conditional probabilities. In fact, the formula for Bayes' theorem is derived from the definition of conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "   P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where P(A | B) is the conditional probability of A given B, P(A ∩ B) is the joint probability of both A and B occurring, and P(B) is the probability of B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Bayes' theorem extends this concept by expressing P(A ∩ B) in terms of P(B | A) and P(A):\n",
    "\n",
    "   P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "   So, Bayes' theorem allows you to calculate conditional probabilities when you know the reverse conditional probability and the prior probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Choosing the type of Naive Bayes classifier for a given problem depends on the nature of the data and the assumptions you are willing to make. The three common types of Naive Bayes classifiers are:\n",
    "   - Gaussian Naive Bayes: Suitable for continuous data where features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
    "   - Multinomial Naive Bayes: Typically used for text data or other discrete data with count-based features (e.g., word frequencies).\n",
    "   - Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Suitable for binary data or data where features are binary (e.g., presence or absence of certain attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "   To choose the appropriate type, consider the characteristics of your data and whether the assumptions of the chosen Naive Bayes variant align with your data's distribution and the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. To predict the class of a new instance with features X1 = 3 and X2 = 4 using Naive Bayes, you can calculate the posterior probabilities for both classes (A and B) and choose the class with the higher probability. Assuming equal prior probabilities for each class, you can use the Naive Bayes formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "   P(Class = A | X1 = 3, X2 = 4) ∝ P(X1 = 3 | Class = A) * P(X2 = 4 | Class = A)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   P(Class = B | X1 = 3, X2 = 4) ∝ P(X1 = 3 | Class = B) * P(X2 = 4 | Class = B)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Calculate these probabilities based on the provided table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   P(X1 = 3 | Class = A) = 4/13\n",
    "   P(X2 = 4 | Class = A) = 3/13\n",
    "\n",
    "   P(X1 = 3 | Class = B) = 1/7\n",
    "   P(X2 = 4 | Class = B) = 3/7\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now, normalize the probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "   P(Class = A | X1 = 3, X2 = 4) = (4/13 * 3/13) / [(4/13 * 3/13) + (1/7 * 3/7)] ≈ 0.6\n",
    "   P(Class = B | X1 = 3, X2 = 4) = (1/7 * 3/7) / [(4/13 * 3/13) + (1/7 * 3/7)] ≈ 0.4\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since P(Class = A | X1 = 3, X2 = 4) > P(Class = B | X1 = 3, X2 = 4), Naive Bayes would predict the new instance to belong to class A."
